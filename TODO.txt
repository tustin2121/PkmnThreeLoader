Animation conversion
===============================================================================

Use the Amie sleep animations for in-battle sleep.
Use the Amie angry responses for "Anticipation" and "Swagger".
Use the Amie happy dancing for a battle victory.
Use the eating animation when eating a berry.

Exceptions:
- Doublade is different between battle and amie (in amie, it is sheithed).
	- Don't use the Amie responses in battle.
	- When the battle ends, play 'appear_hover' at -0.5x speed to sheithe the sword(s), then play the celebratory animation.
- Ghastly never uses its modeled tounge.
	- Use the happy reaction animation from Amie, as that has the tounge waggle.
