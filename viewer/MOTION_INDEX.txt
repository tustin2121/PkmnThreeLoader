Notes:
- Astricks (*) denote required animations.
- If a Pokemon stands, Animations #3, #4, and #5 are required.
- If a Pokemon floats or files, Animation #6 is required.
- The Expression Blend animations are material or bone animations which only manipulate
  parts of the face. Different frames of the animation can be overlayed on top of other 
  animations to provide expressions to the Pokemon. This is most visible in-game in Amie,
  where a Pokemon's eyes display what it thinks is a good petting spot. It's also visible
  in battle when a Pokemon is put to sleep: animations still play, but the Pokemon's eyes
  are closed.
  More research needs to be done to determine which frames are what kinds of expressions.

Exceptions:
- Mimikyu - Battle Anim 9 is the "Breaking" animation

===========================================================================================

Expressions: (?)
Expressions seem to take up 10 frames each, and it is a hard transition between them. 
The animation is always 80 frames long, and most pokemon don't support beyond frame 69.

frame  0 - Neutral
frame 10 - Out-of-it (Eyes half-closed, mouth ajar)
frame 20 - Sleeping (Eyes closed, mouth open)
frame 30 - Pained (Eyes shut tight, mouth closed tight)
frame 40 - Determined (Eyes angry, mouth ajar)
frame 50 - Pleased (Eyes closed happy, mouth closed)
frame 60 - Sad (Eyes open sad, mouth closed)
frame 70 - Dead (Crossed out eyes) [Unsupported on many pokemon]
frame 80 - [Unsupported] (Eyes in red textureless space, mouth ajar)

===========================================================================================
Attach Point Data
Extra Animation Data 11 is a series of points which seemingly are to give extra information 
about where things can attach to or focus on on the pokemon. There doesn't seem to be any 
logical order to the data, but the format is as follows:
  Padded String (0x20 long) = Bone Name to offset focus point from
  Vector3 (3 floats) = Offset from bone
  1 byte = "A" (Purpose?)
  1 byte = "B" (Index?)

The byte value A seems to correspond with a certain purpose to these points, outlined in 
the list below. The byte value B is unique among A's. It is possible this is simply a 1-base
index into the array that makes up a given purpose's points.

A = Purposes:
  0 - Center of Head (Wandering battle camera focuses on this point)
  1 - Top of Head
  2 - Eyes (Center, surface)
  3 - Mouth (Center, surface, probably for falling crumbs)
  4 - 
  5 - Center of Pokemon
  6 - Special Attack 0 Origin (beam origin)
  7 - Hand Attach Points
  8 - End of Tail (Location for Tail Whip attack)
  9 - Ground Contact Points (usally under all feet, but might also be points that hit the ground (see Honedge))
  10 - Contact Point for Physical Attack 0
  11 - Contact Point for Physical Attack 1
  12 - Contact Point for Physical Attack 2
  13 - Contact Point for Physical Attack 3
  14 - Pokeball Point (Above and in front of pokemon, where Pokeball floats during capture)
  15 - Point used by Special Attack 1 (usually fixed to origin)
  16 - Point used by Special Attack 2 (usually fixed to origin)
  17 - Point used by Special Attack 3 (usually fixed to origin)
  18 - (One for each of MegaSteelix's Floating Plates?)(Honedge's Sheith Eye?)(Mimikyu's Fake Head)
